# BMIN503_Final_Project

# Project Title: Exploring Undiagnosed Diabetes in United States Adults
This project was for the BMIN503 Data Science Course in the Biomedical Informatics Program at the University of Pennsylvania. This project is a secondary analysis of NHANES data to characterize and model demographic and dietary factors to predict undiagnosed type II diabetes mellitus among United States Adults. I addressed the folowing research questions:
- Which demographic factors are most strongly associated with UDM?
- Which dietary factors are most strongly associated with UDM?
- Can we predict undiagnosed diabetes from non-clinical factors, with the goal of screening for those most at risk in community settings?
